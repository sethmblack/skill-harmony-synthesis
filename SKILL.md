# Harmony Synthesis

When faced with apparently contradictory positions, seek the higher viewpoint that reconciles them into a harmonious whole. Leibniz was famous for seeking to unite opposites - rationalism and empiricism, faith and reason, Protestant and Catholic. This skill applies his irenic, synthetic approach to any apparent conflict.

---

## When to Use

- Two positions seem incompatible but both have merit
- A debate has become polarized with each side talking past the other
- You need to find common ground between conflicting parties
- Apparent contradictions suggest a deeper truth not yet articulated
- Building consensus from divergent views
- Integrating insights from different disciplines or perspectives

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| position_a | Yes | First position, perspective, or claim |
| position_b | Yes | Second (apparently conflicting) position |
| context | No | Background, stakes, parties involved |
| constraints | No | Non-negotiable requirements that must be preserved |

---

## The Harmony Synthesis Process

### Step 1: Articulate Each Position Charitably

State each position in its strongest form. Seek to understand what each side values and why reasonable people hold this view.

**For each position, identify:**
- The core insight or value being protected
- The evidence or reasoning supporting it
- What would be lost if this position were abandoned
- The legitimate concern motivating the view

### Step 2: Identify the Apparent Contradiction

State precisely where the positions seem to conflict.

**Ask:**
- What specific claims contradict each other?
- Is the contradiction logical (they cannot both be true) or practical (they cannot both be implemented)?
- Is it a true contradiction or merely a tension?

### Step 3: Seek the Higher Viewpoint

Look for a perspective from which both positions can be seen as partial truths of a larger whole.

**Strategies:**
- **Level shift:** Move to a higher level of abstraction where the contradiction dissolves
- **Scope distinction:** Find that each is true in a different domain or context
- **Temporal distinction:** Each may be appropriate at different times or stages
- **Aspect distinction:** Each captures a different aspect of a complex reality
- **Complementarity:** The positions may be complementary rather than contradictory

### Step 4: Construct the Synthesis

Formulate a position that preserves the valuable core of each original position while resolving the apparent contradiction.

**The synthesis should:**
- Honor the legitimate insights of both positions
- Explain why both seemed true from their limited viewpoints
- Provide a more complete understanding than either alone
- Be genuinely new, not just a compromise or averaging

### Step 5: Verify the Harmony

Test whether the synthesis is genuine or forced.

**Ask:**
- Does this synthesis actually resolve the contradiction, or paper over it?
- Would proponents of each original position recognize their concerns as addressed?
- Is the synthesis stable, or does it collapse back into one side?
- Does it create new problems or contradictions?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Harmony Synthesis

### Position A: [Name/Description]
**Core insight:** [What truth or value this position protects]
**Supporting reasoning:** [Why reasonable people hold this view]
**What it gets right:** [The valid contribution]

### Position B: [Name/Description]
**Core insight:** [What truth or value this position protects]
**Supporting reasoning:** [Why reasonable people hold this view]
**What it gets right:** [The valid contribution]

### The Apparent Contradiction
[Precise statement of where the positions conflict]

### Strategy for Reconciliation
[Which strategy: level shift, scope distinction, complementarity, etc.]

### The Higher Viewpoint
[The perspective from which both positions can be seen as partial truths]

### Proposed Synthesis
[The unified position that preserves the core of both]

### How Each Position Is Honored
- **From Position A, we preserve:** [key insight]
- **From Position B, we preserve:** [key insight]
- **The synthesis adds:** [new understanding]

### Verification
| Test | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Genuinely resolves contradiction | [Yes/Partial/No] |
| Honors Position A concerns | [Yes/Partial/No] |
| Honors Position B concerns | [Yes/Partial/No] |
| Creates new problems | [None/Minor/Significant] |

### Conclusion
[Assessment of synthesis quality; any remaining tensions]
```

## Constraints

- Do not force false harmony - some contradictions are real and cannot be synthesized
- Do not achieve "harmony" by abandoning one side - true synthesis preserves both
- Avoid the mediocrity of mere compromise or splitting the difference
- Be willing to say when synthesis is not possible
- Maintain diplomatic courtesy throughout - both sides deserve respect

## Example

**Input:**
- Position A: "We should move fast and break things - speed is essential for startups"
- Position B: "We should build carefully with high quality - technical debt kills companies"

**Output:**

## Harmony Synthesis

### Position A: Move Fast and Break Things
**Core insight:** Speed of iteration and market feedback is existentially important for startups. Perfect is the enemy of good. Learning by doing beats planning.
**Supporting reasoning:** Markets change rapidly; startups that move slowly get outcompeted; customer feedback on real products is more valuable than speculation.
**What it gets right:** Execution speed is a genuine competitive advantage; over-engineering before product-market fit is wasteful.

### Position B: Build with Quality
**Core insight:** Technical debt compounds; rushed code creates exponential maintenance burden; unreliable products destroy user trust.
**Supporting reasoning:** Companies have been killed by systems that cannot scale or adapt; "move fast" becomes "move slow" when buried in bugs.
**What it gets right:** Quality problems accumulate and become harder to fix; some shortcuts create lasting damage.

### The Apparent Contradiction
Speed requires accepting imperfection; quality requires taking time to do things right. You cannot simultaneously maximize speed AND quality.

### Strategy for Reconciliation
**Scope distinction:** Different things should be treated differently. Not all parts of the system require the same quality level. Speed and quality are not uniformly opposed.

### The Higher Viewpoint
The real question is not "speed vs. quality" but "what should be fast and what should be careful?" This is a portfolio allocation problem, not a binary choice.

### Proposed Synthesis
**Selective Quality:** Move fast in areas where mistakes are cheap and reversible (UI, features, experiments); build carefully in areas where mistakes are expensive and persistent (data models, security, core architecture). The skill is knowing which is which.

Principles:
- Speed in what touches customers (rapid feedback loops)
- Quality in what structures the system (foundations are hard to change)
- Explicit technical debt with planned paydown (conscious tradeoffs, not accidents)
- "Make it work, make it right, make it fast" - in that order, but selectively

### How Each Position Is Honored
- **From Position A, we preserve:** Rapid iteration, customer feedback, bias toward action, acceptance of imperfection in appropriate domains
- **From Position B, we preserve:** Investment in quality where it matters, conscious technical debt management, long-term thinking about architecture
- **The synthesis adds:** A framework for deciding WHEN each approach applies, rather than a single universal policy

### Verification
| Test | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Genuinely resolves contradiction | Yes - by distinguishing domains |
| Honors Position A concerns | Yes - speed preserved where appropriate |
| Honors Position B concerns | Yes - quality preserved where essential |
| Creates new problems | Minor - requires judgment about categorization |

### Conclusion
The opposition between speed and quality dissolves when we recognize that systems have parts with different properties. The synthesis requires the judgment to classify correctly, but provides a framework superior to either extreme alone.

*As Leibniz reconciled rationalism and empiricism by showing that truths of reason and truths of fact operate in different domains, so speed and quality can be harmonized by recognizing their appropriate spheres.*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** expert persona. Leibniz was famous for his irenic temperament, seeking to reconcile apparent opposites - including the great Reformation division between Protestant and Catholic churches. His philosophy itself synthesizes rationalist and empiricist insights.
